        This week was a cool one because we learned of the different CSS properties
         and how they can be used to style and alter our websites. We now have the 
        ability to change 
        <span style="color:aqua">color</span>,
        <span style="font-size: 20px"> size</span>, and 
        <span style="font-family: verdana">fonts</span>
        as well as many other aspects of a page's presentation. Overall a very neat 
        week in the world of web development.
