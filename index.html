<h>Blog Post 1</h>
<p>So far i've learned far more than I thought I was going to in the first week of webdev.<br> 
    I had never touched HTML, web hosting, domains, or even vscode live sharing before this<br> 
    class. So now that i've had the chance to get my feet wet I hope to learn more and delve <br>
    deeper into the world of web development and hopefully gain a deeper appreciation for<br>
    the internet and the tape that holds it together.<br><br>

    As for relavant coding examples I didnt even know what a header, paragraph, or anything<br>
    was so id say that even this blog post is a coding example of what ive learned so far.
