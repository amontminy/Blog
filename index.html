<p>So far i've learned far more than I thought I was going to in the first week of webdev.<br> 
    I had never touched HTML, web hosting, domains, or even vscode live sharing before this class.<br>
    So now that i've had the chance to get my feet wet I hope to learn more and delve deeper into the world of<br>
    web development and hopefully gain a deeper appreciation for the internet and the tape that holds<br>
    it together.
