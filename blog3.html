            This was a week of flexing for web development where we delved 
            into the world of wow we hate formatting. But our ancestors of 
            the keyboard before us came up with these nifty things called 
            flexboxes that saved many a web developer that came after them. 
            They allow fun grouping and formatting of content much more user 
            friendly than just trying to achieve the same level in CSS alone.<br><br>
            
            They allow the ability for expansion of windows, centering and 
            distributing elements, formatting of all children within a parent
             element and much more.
