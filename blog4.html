            This week was a little less pertinent to my web blog as I dont 
            really have a lot to add to the blog. As for the lessons in 
            chapter 6 and 7 the book seemed to focus on making our web 
            deployments valid for all sorts of devices as well as having 
            anchoring and positioning that will adapt rather than having 
            to specify different HTML for every type of device you may 
            encounter.<br.<br>

            We also learned fun transformation like rotation, absolute position 
            how to fade to black when our text is too long, all neat stuff. 
            Overall an interesting week and I hope it helps with the development 
            of P1.
